# Facial Recognition Attendance System with MySQL Integration

This repository contains a **Facial Recognition Attendance System** that leverages machine learning and **MySQL database integration** to automate attendance tracking. The system detects and recognizes faces in real-time, logs attendance, and provides flexible database access for schools and administrators.

## Features
- **Real-time facial detection and recognition**
- **MySQL database integration** for centralized attendance management
- **Class management**: Easily organize students into classes
- **Daily, Monthly, and Term-Based Attendance Tracking**:
  - Attendance data is stored in MySQL, allowing schools to track records by day, month, or academic term (semester).
  - Supports efficient queries for generating reports based on time periods or class groups.
- **Attendance logging with timestamps**
- **User-friendly interface**
- **Scalable and customizable**

## App Variations
 The mysql version we work with the most is the best version. Pandas also works well but needs adjustments and debugging. PyQT5 is still in developement and incomplete.
